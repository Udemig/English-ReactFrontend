    <!-- ! We started our software journey with HTML. 
     We observed the code written in .html files in the browser. 
     Then we met CSS to style these elements, which have default values. 
     We wrote CSS code in .css files. To link these .css files to the HTML file, we used the 'link' tag. 
     Now, we will make the elements we created in HTML and styled in CSS dynamic with JavaScript. 
     We will write the JavaScript code in .js files. 
     To link these files to the HTML, we will use the 'script' tag.  -->
    <!-- * Javascript Linking -->
    <script src="./main.js"></script>
